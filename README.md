# Iterative Teacher-Aware Learning

## Human Experiments

This repository contains code used for the human experiments. The code for ITAL can be found under the CL directory, and the code responsible for managing human interfaces is in the Game directory. Each map used in our experiments corresponds to one of the ```test_script.ipynb```  Jupyter notebooks.

Data saving has been disabled for submission, but the interface used is still usable and interactive. 

Detailed instructions for the human experiments can be found in the ```Introduction.ipynb``` notebook.
